DESCRIPTION

    This script takes as input a delivery file from Kamstrup (encrypted,
    compressed KEM file), unpacks it and splits the file into different
    decoded XML files that can be further processed.

    Minimal input to the script are the encryption key and the input file.
    If no further configuration file is passed then all information in the
    input file is written to the output file.

    A configuration file consists of a CSV file with `;` as delimeter and
    the following columns:

    kamstrup_ordernr;kamstrup_serial_number_start;kamstrup_serial_number_end;number_of_devices;internal_batch_number

    The output file name will be
    [kamstrup_ordernr]_[internal_batch_number].

    Following functions are available in this package:

    unzip_kem

      Extracts the KEM file from the archive file delivered by Kamstrup. Do
      not forget to delete the file after processing.

      Takes the archive file name as input. Returns the filename.

    decode_kem

      Decode an encrypted KEM file, requires the input filename and the
      encryption key.

      Returns the decrypted XML contents of the KEM file as string.

    split_order

      Extracts the contents of a specific order from the combined Kamstrup
      KEM file.

      Takes as input the parsed content of the KEM file (meter details),
      the lowest meter number in the order, and the highest meter number in
      the order.

      Returns all meter information of the devices that match the filter
      criteria.

    read_config

      Read a CSV configuration file containing the various sub orders.

      CSV needs to be separated with ';' and needs to contain the headers
      'kamstrup_ordernr', 'kamstrup_serial_number_start',
      'kamstrup_serial_number_end', 'number_of_devices' and
      'internal_batch_number'.

    parse_cml_string_to_data

      Convert the XML from the decoded file into a Perl datastructure that
      can be processed programmatorically.

    write_xml_output

      Write the filtered XML to a file taking into account the required
      formatting.

      Takes as input the xml skeleton structure

    write_kem2_xml_output

      Write the raw KEM2 file output to a file with name based on the
      ordercodes in the file.

      Takes as input the raw xml string
